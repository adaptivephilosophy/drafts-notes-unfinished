# Draft values statement about community engagement

I gave some thought to what I would like to say about community engagement and involvement in online discourse.  I know we are a software company and we like to make apps and create cool things with technology and it could be controversial to allow discussion of other topics, but we are also part of broader communities and we would like to encourage members to have involvement in the world of ideas as well and participate in the development of the software of our minds and communities through language and culture. We want to respect the rights of people to have or share their well intentioned beliefs and opinions without fear of recrimination.  So I thought that crafting a vision and values statement about that might be good or helpful to address these ideas.  With any of these ideas in adaptive philosophy, they are not set in stone, but can be revised and discussed for improvements any time to add or address other unconsidered nuances of it.  This is just the current draft and it is open to discussion. 

## Values statement about community engagement and online discourse.

We give back to the community and participate in initiatives that promote social good. We encourage members to share or hold their own personal political, philosophical, scientific, religious or spiritual beliefs and opinions and engage politely with others in the community about them online or in person privately or publicly as they see fit, following their own conscience as part of their civic responsibility and rights as free individuals.

Free and open communication about ideas and needs, including discussion of controversial topics or ideas, exposing hidden corruption or crimes, preventing acts of evil, or otherwise acting in good faith to prevent harm or promote what a person believes is or seems good to them is essential for progress, optimization, accountability, de-escalation of tensions, and problem resolution. The tensions ratchet up in to full gear when those rights are ever violated, so we see constant drama as various people pull those strings and push all those buttons. However, we do not necessarily endorse or take responsibility for the actions or thoughts and beliefs of **other people** or individual members based on association or whatever they read, say, or research.  

We are not required to nor would want to intentionally assist with disseminating harmful content that viciously attacks, demeans, cruelly mocks others, or is otherwise not conducive to constructive dialogue, or creates unnecessary problems for us or that significantly or repeatedly degrades quality, is too gross or disturbing to us, or adds spam without correction, or in some way violates the rights, safety, or integrity of others here. 

Individuals have the right to associate or not associate based on differences in their values and beliefs and to comment and share opinions, agree or disagree, or like or dislike as they see fit regarding the ethics or morality of particular behaviors or policies or alert others about things they are concerned about.

People are responsible for themselves, and we assume most are grownups and whatever they decide to do is up to them.  We can offer suggestions or enforce laws or have consequences in some extreme circumstances to prevent or deter people from committing acts that violate the physical safety or rights of others, but the people are ultimately accountable to themselves and maybe a Higher Power, Creator, God, or whatever that most beautiful divine loving presence and state we can encounter in our hearts and souls minds when we enter places of worship and out in a secluded place nature or when looking at the stars or sunset, the Holy Ghost maybe, just awesome glory beyond imagination and words, infinite, it makes you like weep it is so amazing powerful and beautiful and we can have our own relationship with That if we want however it comes to us whenever we want, and we don’t need to tell others about it if we choose not to.  That’s between me and That, not you guys, or whatever you are. 

(I can’t say that I understand it or have everything figured our know right now what is going on, but there could be something.  It could also be something my brain is doing with my unconscious mind and way I am interpreting things an somatic hallucinations or delusions too, or an ego state in my brain.  I’m not sure.  But it seems to real in my realm in here, it seems benevolent and loving to me, and I love having it and being with it.  I’m not sure what all the words actully mean though sometimes.  Its like non verbal with me, and I do not usually hear any voices, but something like another kind of awareness or level of consciousness where meaning can flow.  It is not easy to describe. However, I’m not a guru or intend to be a like a spiritual leader, prophet or anything like that. I’m not interested in that.  For me it is just a personal journey of discovery and mystery.  Just me, nothing fancy or more specialness about me any more than than anyone else.  It’s the same God I learned about as a child.   In our religion we called God the father, Creator of the heavens and earth. I act as if itI’ll do another post on it sometime maybe.  But I’m not trying to recruit people to a religion or cult or anything like that. I’m not a scholar of religious texts.  But I think about that stuff. Sorry, this is a tangent.)

We do not see any reason why anyone should  be forced to change or hide our beliefs or forced to believe, say, or do anything that is against our own conscience or religious beliefs. We don’t have to explain or answer to anyone other than God about our own relationship or connection with God or how God comes to us if God does, nor do we have to  involve anyone else with it or have to defend ourselves have justify about whatever we think about that to other mortals if we don’t feel like it.  We don’t have to follow what any other people are saying or doing either, about that or anything else for that matter.  You can go straight to the Source yourself and chat and meditate or pray with God all day long if you like and it is between you and God whatever you know about that or chat about. That’s all top secret classified information in my psyche, sorry.

We strive to be accurate and factual and to correct our mistakes, but we also recognize that there may be differences in understanding or disagreements about the accuracy of the stated facts from whatever official or unofficial sources, and that there may be mistakes or misleading or otherwise false information provided by various sources intentionally or unintended that can deceive or manipulate in a way that may need further scrutiny and questioning. We do not intentionally provide false information and we humbly welcome feedback about any need for potential corrections. 

It is the role of the listener or reader to decide what to do with the provided information, how to discern the validity or interpret it, and also to control how it affects them personally or emotionally.  Simply reading or researching a topic does not necessarily mean that a person agrees or endorses or correctly understands whatever they are reading , nor does it mean that whatever they are reading or hearing or thinking is correct to begin with or what was intended by the speaker or author, nor does it follow necessarily how any person might react to whatever is said or written. 

We are free to explore and decide for ourselves what to think or feel about whatever topic we want, and we might be curious about things we don’t understand or know about, and want to know more or just learn about other people, without people trampling all over their realities and or their beliefs or assuming things, and we can share their reactions, imagination, or creativity with whomever wants to listen.   If we want others to respect our rights, we give others the same respect to have a conscience or understanding of the world that is different, which could also be a possible way that it is and we don’t know what a person believes unless we talk to them about it, and might be even more or better than what I know now, so I am curious to learn about how others are seeing, believing and experiencing in their worlds too and I try to love everyone as I love myself.

 I don’t want to fight with anyone over that or exclude people from entering into my spheres who have different beliefs about that, because I would be missing out on knowing and being or becoming friends with lots of great people and I love em all.  I let God,  if God exists, to handle all that part with them whenever that time is if God comes to them that way in this life, maybe not, or it could all be random or something else. God is my judge. I’m glad they gave me that name, because it makes it easier for me to remember that.

Our goal as part of Adaptive Philosophy, if we engage in philosophical discourse, is to focus on the issues, ideas, and arguments for the purpose of promoting public good, resolving grievances, enhancing understanding, improving wellbeing, or for enjoyment or interest, and we find solutions through reason and logical analysis, but we are also sensitive to and understand emotional needs and concerns, and believe in advocacy, accessibility, and inclusion. We like looking at the other sides of things here and trying to understand various points in disagreement from all sides.

We do not typically focus on or promote negative characterizations or impressions of other people or groups based on projections and beliefs about their unstated intentions or incidental or unrelated associations or aspects of their communication, situation, background, personality or body characteristics, abilities, culture, or customs. But that does not mean that we do not appreciate comedy or impersonations of leaders in other venues for amusement and fun. That is different.  

We are referring to useless information about people presented as an argument or provided during an argument for or about something that is unrelated to points in debate. When we focuses on the features of a person not the issues we can become distracted that and caught up in those details, we can end up spending  all our time focusing on that, or comments that don’t address anything important,  or otherwise lead to bad reasons to accept an argument for the points.   We might strongly dislike a person or candidate, but still prefer them to someone else, or agree with various policy positions they have.   Choosing a particular candidate does not mean we endorse all of the ideas and positions of they have nor is it necessary defend any ideas we disagree with. We might win some things and lose other things we might want from the other candidate when we choose. We observe people focusing on totally different things during the process of making their selections. 

But we also believe is important also to provide feedback to leaders too about what we are focusing on, and the character traits of leaders can be a legitimate concerns pertaining to ability to maintain group cohesion, competence in the job of leading and inspiring others, the way they react to events or treat and work with others and set good examples, and the degree to which these traits indicate potential risks for poor judgement, or how it affects their trustworthiness, creates unnecessary division, etc. I only point out things with the intention of helping others to improve and to give hints about the sorts of things people are actually concerning or important to people.  Many people do not base their decisions on affiliation with a political party.  Independent voters, or people with no party preference, last time I checked, well, let’s ask our assistant here has to say about that.

  ChatGPT replies, “A substantial number of Americans identify as independents, meaning they do not formally align with either of the two major parties. This group can sometimes represent the largest single segment of the electorate, depending on how questions are asked in surveys. Some independents lean towards one of the major parties while others are strictly nonpartisan.”

We focus on the ideas, concepts, data, and models here, not dwell too much on personal characteristics of the particular people or groups who have the ideas, nor base opinions about various issues on party affiliation here.  It is not clear to us why we would want to add personal or group details about the messenger(s) or actors of the particular issues or points of view being discussed, or why if an issue position comes from a one group or the other does it give us good reason to accept it.  It is not always important who said or reported a particular idea, or who likes who.  Whatever statements and ideas made can evaluated independently of any person or group, i.e., the names of the people or groups can be changed or removed without affecting validity or reliability, or soundness  of the underlying assumptions and arguments being made about a particular topic or issue, unless it is something about about the person directly that is concerning or somehow has important baring on the pressing issues at hand. 

Even within the parties there can be significant disagreements about various policies, and the parties are less important to many voters.  Depending on the issues that are being pushed by the parties, we might choose someone we dislike to prevent something we strongly disagree with from going  through that is being pushed relentlessly by the other side.  We might disagree with everything else and dislike a candidate immensely, but still vote for them because we want to keep our rights that others are desperately trying to take away, and that is a no go to some voters.  We can do that if we see the issue as more important than personality traits or communication style.  I’m not sure who comes up with all the news scripts and talking points, but they don’t usually talk about or hit a lot of the things I’m thinking about. And a lot of the the other things people are saying or concerned or talking about have nothing to do with the decisions that I made or make what I am focusing on.

We are generally nice here, but can also at times express frustrations or rant or be funny about or parody something if we want while also respecting others if it amuses us, but we are also free change our minds about whatever we previously said or wrote and edit it again later to clarify or to reflect a new understanding or state of mind.  If there is an issue with something that is said, please politely and respectfully bring it to the attention of the person who said it and give them a chance to correct or remove it.  If we are truly concerned about it or  care about what the other person thinks and want to help the person to consider something else, we give them a chance and time to clarify or apologize or let them choose for themselves how to respond to our objections. We can also boycott or block people we don’t like from appearing on our devices and we don’t have a list of required readings or positions that anyone is obligated to accept.

Our beliefs and opinions are not necessarily static or fixed.  We recognize the capacity for people to grow, learn, and or change throughout life, and we are hopefully learning from past mistakes.  It is not necessary to permanently ruin a person’s life or career over an unfortunate gotcha comment or something said out of context or when they were not thinking clearly or were expressing private thoughts or humor and not aware of the audience, or uttered something inappropriate or unkind a long time ago when they were younger or privately with their buddies and families, or tweeted something strange or stupid in their sleep while taking sleep medication, published drafts online unedited, or just because they happen to have a different point of view about a topic.  We give people a chance to make amends if they make mistakes or clarify if they didn’t word something very well the first time or if they neglect, forget, or were mistaken about something.  We can forgive if it seems sincere and we allow for differences of opinions. We strive for charitable interpretations and give people the benefit of the doubt when we aren’t sure. Do we have to have perfect people everywhere and banish anyone who makes a mistake or makes some careless unthoughtful or rude comment?  That seems silly and unnecessary to us.

We do not assume an individual has any particular beliefs or thinks the same way as others based on whatever groups they belong to or associate with if the person has not explicitly expressed or endorsed a particular belief, and we do not hold all individuals in a group responsible for what other members of a group do or say.  We address individuals and their specific claims, not nebulous perceptions or stereotypes of ways entire group, which could be millions of totally different people doing their own thins just like in your culture or group.  My friends are all different.  Even with my own siblings who look like me, but we have different education, interests, differ in all sorts of interesting ways, different opinions, beliefs, not just physically, but different personalities, and so on.  I might have more in common with people who look totally different from me, that I do with my own siblings in personality traits, or interests, etc.  Why do people talk like they do not know that? You are the one and only you, and so is everyone else.  

We are accountable and responsible for our own behaviors and things that we personally do ourselves with our individual bodies, whatever other people do is still up to them no matter what anybody tells them. If someone tells you to go jump off a cliff, is it their fault if you do it?  I’m confused about this silliness. We do not hold people accountable for things they haven’t done to anyone themselves or for acts committed long ago by deceased or even living relatives or people who have similar appearances or traits. Why should someone be accountable for what someone else did and had nothing to do with or wasn’t even alive? Where did this silliness come from that we are responsible for what other people do?  We don’t control them nor want to.  We want people to control themselves not others, unless it is an emergency or something or maybe physically moving their bodies. We do not control their minds though or what they say.  I don’t know how to do that.  There is something very confusing to  me about this apparent discrepancy in my understanding about these things I’m encountering. I’ll have to research that and think about point and come back to it later. Nevertheless, we also intend to be careful and thoughtful in what we chose to say here and consider potential impact or how it might affect others, and recognize past or current mistakes and injustices for the purpose of healing any trauma passed down from our ancestors who may have been fighting, competing, and abusing each other since the dawn of human existence all over the world.  (*fix)

We do not act with any malicious intent and do not believe in targeting people or groups with blanket exaggerated language or somehow preventing others from being able to freely communicate and share their perspectives.  We avoid providing any unnecessary information or language, or withholding or presenting information in such a way that creates confusion or distractions and or prevents us being able to address issues with clarity or in a truthful and sincere way. We do not act in a way that creates an unwelcoming, threatening, or negative environment for others to discuss or disagree about ideas and policies here and we do not intentionally misrepresent what others are doing and saying. That’s counterproductive and only creates more problems with communication.  

We are striving to improve ourselves and correct or evolve our previous assumptions, methods, and beliefs if better options are made available or are revealed to us in some way, and we know that everyone is fallible.   We also have different moods or sides of ourselves that can triggered in various circumstances, and people often say things in certain emotional states that they do not mean or that they later regret. Okay, we all do that. It is not the end of the world if that happens, although it may be upsetting or cause triggering reaction to words, i.e., noises that comes out of our mouths and seeing squiggly lines that make us think someone doesn’t like us or that is not a good or nice word. 

We understand it is the meaning and context of it and agree maybe is not something proper, considerate, or nice and we agree it’s maybe not good to needlessly say something hurtful or unkind to others if it creates problems, I guess.  But do we need to  outlaw saying anything that is not proper, considerate, kind, or maybe not  good or nice, because it could possibly upset someone? Making certain utterances or writing or even just sharing words punishable with fines, arrest, harassment and intimidation or whatever else and strain the limited resources we have to fight actual crimes.  Would we end up laying awake in bed at night terrified think or even imagine we might say something that might say be upsetting to someone, or get a wrong slip of the tongue from our unconscious mind, or Alexa might pick up something I say wrong when I’m sleeping. Dang, now the police are going to barge in with a swat team and get us for saying that and we end up in jail or losing everything.  Thanks a lot Mr. unconscious mind, now we are screwed because of your silly games, again!

So now people are apparently worried that we might big trouble if we say something wrong or get heard talking about something we’re not supposed to ever talk about, or worried now we might caught us writing something down we aren’t allowed to write…  Or…. shhh…psst.. (quiet whisper in you  ear here) …

  reading something that people might not like…

  ooooo…  Oh my! Gotcha! We are in big trouble now! Don’t tell anyone about our secret that your eyes looked at forbidden words that are not liked.  Are we children or grownups? Okay, sorry, getting carried away here, but really?  All of this seems a bit silly and unnecessary or extreme or even absurd or even utter nonsense to us with all the other stuff that is going on.  Let’s not do that.  We like freedom of speech here. We don’t usually go out of our way to piss people off here and usually use nice and friendly with words, but we don’t want to give up any rights to say what we might want to say or write sometime if we were in the mood or felt like saying something not nice even on a whim if we felt like it for some reason. Who knows…  

Anyway, all that seems like a lot of silliness to me and like a like an amazing spectacle, but in fairness, I appreciate the difficulties faced by people who are on the outside of things.  We’ve been through plenty of that fun and not fun stuff.   I know or can appreciate that it can be very difficult or even destabilizing for some people to be exposed to negativity directed toward them, or it can cause escalations in tensions between various groups, if a particular member of one group says something not nice about a member of the other group that they don’t like, now we got wars and crazy stuff going stuff all over the place it and thousands of people die because of it because, you see, if a few members of a group, people who might not even know each other but who look the same maybe, now everyone in the group is to blame for the actions of just a few people in the groups, and they are all to blame even though most of the people killed had nothing to do with it and had no clue it even happened or who those other bad people were and whatever they did or said to each other.  

Also, people might have been through terrible things we have no idea, are maybe fragile or frightened, or they haven’t yet developed stronger internal defenses to process negativity directed toward them.  There may be ways that people can learn to have stronger defenses and confidence, and decrease the severity of those responses working with a therapist, and we respect that and encourage that.  Maybe get a buddy or something like we did when we were children, and just practice saying mean things to each other for like five or ten minutes a day in a safe supportive environment, like have fun with it, until the responses to negativity are less severe and serious.  Check with them about it though, I’m not sure if that is right, so work with  someone you trust.   Just an idea off the top of my head and I don’t know.  It might even be fun and funny that way to say wrong forbidden things and words, but be real quiet maybe.  After a while those noises are not so terrible and don’t hurt one bit.  Maybe after a while we get desensitized to it and don’t care any more, they are just words and maybe some stupid person saying some gibberish, but who cares.  Tell them to f-off if you even care to respond to it.  

Your point of view is just as valid as the next person, so why do you need to go by someone else’s interpretation of you or whatever is going on and be sad about that if it wasn’t right according to you?  Maybe it doesn’t matter what anybody thinks of you.  Why would we care what some jerk thinks?  Maybe check with a therapist and tell them that is what you want to achieve a zen state of not caring what others say, and we don’t have to like them back!  Take that guy, or whatever you are!  I don’t like you either! Maybe see if it helps or experiment some other technique if that doesn’t help.  

Keep that sort of thing in mind folks, we have a lot of differences and everyone is different or may be at different levels of development about certain things, and we want to help them out if we can and look out for them and help them out if they want because we love our neighbors.  Or just be considerate of that and avoid the whole thing?

Policing thoughts and words seems too difficult to track everyone down and lock them all up. It might cost a lot of money to make all the prisons and stuff too.  That would be a tough thing to get everyone who said the wrong things I think and it wouldn’t probably work I don’t think. It costs about $80,000 per prisoner a year or more, I think, so that would cost a fortune to put so many of those bad talkers in there. That’s more than more than most people make in a year working.  It costs more to send someone to prison school then doctor schools I guess, but we don’t have money for doctors to go to school.  Getting those bad talkers and people who take drugs is more important than making doctors, I guess.  We should check those facts though, maybe that number isn’t right. 

Let’s see what ChatGPT says:

“In the United States, the cost can range from tens of thousands to over a hundred thousand dollars annually per inmate. According to various reports and studies, including those from state departments of corrections and organizations researching criminal justice issues, the average cost is often cited as being between $30,000 and $40,000 per inmate per year. However, in some high-cost areas like New York or California, the average cost per inmate can exceed $60,000 or even reach beyond $80,000 annually.”

I guess we were right.  Wow! But do we know if ChatGPT is right? How do we check?  Isn’t it interesting researching things and finding out things like that? All sort of silly things going here we aren’t allowed to talk about, I guess. 

And we got millions of those people already in there for taking or having drugs, now we have to add in the bad talkers too.  Maybe we could get a ballpark estimate for how much that might cost to put the all bad talkers in there with em. I don’t think that would work because we don’t have enough, and we also got like 30 trillion in debt!  Haha!  Whooo hoo! we got a long way to go on that sucker.  By the way, I was wondering if anyone knows  the plan about how we are going to pay that back?  Are we really planning to pay that back, or can we get out of it with like taking it to  bankruptcy court or something and go on with our lives and not worry about it any more?  That’s what people have to do when they go to the hospital in a ambulance or something to get out of that crazy bill.  So I think maybe the policing ideas solution proly wouldn’t work, plus people might start talking even more not nice too if we do that and the whole thing will be a big mess and cost us zillions of more dollars, and maybe they can’t make the money that fast. So let’s forget that idea. Maybe we just gotta get the heck out of here!

Okay, we also like some of those other rights too, like being able to assemble and associate and discuss or promote their ideas with each other, the right to have legal protections for ownership of possessions and privacy, and have fair and speedy trials with justice and judgement of guilt or innocence determined by a jury of our peers with the presumption of innocence until found found guilty by the preponderance of evidence and use of proper reliable procedures for determining that with impartiality or minimal bias.  Do they even do anything other than charge each other with stuff and argue about it …, oh wait, wait, we won’t get into that silliness with the courts and stuff, we have to be afraid saying anything that might make the people working public service jobs mad, cus man they gonna get your ass if you do that kind of talk with guns and stuff,  and you disappear your ass now in a terrorist prison man, if you say the wrong things they don’t like it, I guess.  Or they’ll sue you for a trillion dollars or something like that for being that kind of bad talker, and of course you lose because they don’t like that kind of talk, questioning things and saying wrong things and stuff, ooo boy, they don’t like that that kind of talk one bit, that makes them look bad or something. OO boy, we wouldn’t want to do that!  I guess.

Where were we… Okay, so we also have the right to protect ourselves or others and our belongings or defend our physical integrity and personal spaces, and own deadly weapons to stop people from killing us or our families or other people in our communities when it is necessary to immediately stop them and there are no armed guards or people standing by next to us ready to jump in help us the moment something goes wrong, whoever they may be.  

Here is one.  Have you ever heard that we can make our own medical decisions and expect to be properly informed about any known risks and options and only proceed when our clearly expressed informed consent is given to put whatever goes into or happens to our bodies.  I guess they forgot to tell me about the part where they alter my genes or DNA or and put other weird stuff in there or something? Is that right? How do we find out ? I thought they said we would all die from COVID if we don’t take it and its all perfectly safe , nothing to worry  about at all.  Or are we all going to die now like “they” say? Who is in charge? Does anyone know? Is there anyone? Or are we just running around doing whatever?  It is hard to get information out here because all  the news is like propaganda about all those bad guys and people we need to get, and not relevant to any issues problems or silliness we see out here.  We are gonna win a contest or something and get on TV get pictures of ourselves and stuff, what are you talking about? I guess. I’m not sure.

Okay, where were we…  We can believe whatever we want, worship, pray or not pray however and whenever we like, prosper and keep or do whatever we want with what we earn, make, or are given. We can think about anything or read or listen to whatever we feel like or want. We can vote for whomever we want and expect to have our equally weighted vote accurately counted in our jurisdictions without fear, intimidation, or cheating or subversion of the electoral process or system, or intrusion into the privacy of our selections. The general public decides who our leaders will be and what laws and policies we make by the majorities or super majorities of the people and duly elected bodies.  The combined judgment tens of millions of informed voters from all walks of life should not be overruled by few random people currently working various public service jobs or party operatives who strongly prefer or fear a particular outcome, regardless of whatever party they belong to.  Did that happen? I’m not sure.

 People have the right to peacefully protest the government for redress of grievances or question accuracy and reliability of results and procedures or present evidence of any wrongdoing or coverups, and we respect and take seriously any concerns about election integrity.  Addressing these concerns openly and seriously is vital for peaceful transition of power and maintaining order and agreement with the nonviolent fair process of deciding leaders through voting instead of force and violence.  It seems like there were a lot of people saying stuff like that, including movies and all sorts or silly stuff, yet, it doesn’t look like they are saying they are satisfied or there is a covup going on.  Is that right ?  I’m not sure.

We love our freedoms here. Okay, Let’s continue.  We can move where we want to live or work where it is available and leave whatever it pleases us.  We can even pick out and wear clothing we like or style and groom our own hair and make it longer or shorter, curls or color or whatever, and express ourselves however we like all by ourselves! Wow! We get to pick out our own undergarments too!  We pursue whatever dreams and hobbies we prefer, and teach our children or others our values and cultural heritage or communities or whatever the parental or personal judgment is without force or coercion or indoctrination to something else we don’t want.  

We can love or be intimate with any another consenting adult of our choosing and we do not need permission or need to explain our personal preferences or what we do in our homes and love life to other nosy and intrusive strangers or religious fanatics or even well intentioned others who do not approve of our personal choices or the way our bodies or minds work.  How shocking and silly it seems to me that is that it was ever considered acceptable or a critical  priority for the government to violate the autonomy of other grownups that way and force people to adhere to weird regulations of their personal intimacy with or harass people for associating  with other consenting adults they love or wish to be with for whatever reason.  We even get to handle our own personal intimate relationships with other grownups all by ourselves, without interference from others or the with guidance of our wise government employees or telling us what we should want or are allowed to do about that.  What a great idea!  And people can exclude people they don’t like from their places or worship or say or do whatever they like about that there too, and who cares. Go to another place of worship where they love you if you are into that.  

We are all free to love or hate or communicate about what we think or want or feel, get angry or raise our voices about things if we feel like it, and even maybe offend others or use whatever nasty language we choose to describe things about whatever or however we like in agreement or disagreement with anyone within our own spheres of influence or platforms, and we don’t have to apologize for anything if we don’t want to or don’t feel badly about or didn’t do, nor does anyone have to care at all what other people think or say about our choices or whatever they are focusing on or watching.  I don’t like a lot of nastiness though.  I’m too busy for a lot of drama, plus that is not my normal (for me) nice guy mode.

In short, we make our own lives however we want and mind our own business regarding the personal lives and choices of others. Every person is considered equal in rights and privileges under the law, and nobody is required to get permission from other grownups to do or say whatever they want to themselves and or with adults if all is good with them and they are just off doing harmless something they like and not bothering anyone.  

The first priority for me after maintaining my own mental and spiritual well being is always the safety and protection of children from any kind of harm, abuse, or exploitation, and ensuring each child has everything they need or we can give them to be successful.  We are also taking care of seniors and people with genuine disabilities that impact their ability to work or generate income or otherwise impaired ability to care for themselves.  I have to maintain my own mental and spiritual health before I am able to engage in helping others or have the ability to do anything, but of course, children are more important than whatever happens to me or other adults.  Getting them safe and ready to be successful is the number one priority I think.  That may be our only hope. Our families, friends, friendly animal companions need to be alright and hopefully happy too. Then we are concerned about wider communities we are from and the rest of the world at large or any changes or life goals, personal projects like this at home that I am currently working on, or other employment related work, if we have it.  That is what we are up to here, just struggling through it the best we can, and hopefully we make it through for a while, but we are also aware that we can drop dead at any moment, and life is short and almost over regardless.

What other people do with their freedom or how they choose to communicate with others or live their lives is their business.  We aren’t required to listen or read anything we don’t like or agree with either.  Visitors are free and can do whatever they like or go somewhere else and we respect those rights, and we hope that they respect the rights of others too wherever they go.   On this blog however, we like to be cool and casual, lighthearted, respectful and helpful people trying to be good and enjoy life and do what seems to be the right things to us, and we are open to examining fresh or unusual perspectives, or needle some interesting ideas. It isn’t the main purpose of the blog, but we may pop things up every now and then when we have time.  We are also allowed to make our own groups or organize them whatever way we like and let in others or not let in others to participate our own private peaceful gatherings or meetings to talk amongst ourselves without noisy interference, and we can select our language for publications from our group however choose.  🕊️

## Final comments - We are  in need of funding and sponsorship!

… whew! Okay, that was a bit long winded I guess,  apologies, just got carried away I think there.  I added a lot of stuff about other rights that wasn’t planning at the start. There were some other issues I put in there and took out.  I was in the zone and on a role there today.  I’ll go back and edit it more later and maybe condense it a bit or restructure it when I have more time.  I still like to do things like that without the ai. It might be good to do a post about topics related to AI to discuss thoughts and experiments with it.  These are just some notes I am making as I go. 

On another personal note and for transparency, I’m just getting started with this project and I’m between jobs at the moment, and running very low on funds here and have been working very hard for as long as I can remember.  If anyone wanted or was able to help with some funds to keep it going, or have a opensource software project in mind for me to work on for you or some contract work or a project I can work on or join, I greatly appreciate any contact or any supporting funds, or a job! It would make a world of difference here.  The following link contains more about that:
